Cubic Chaos

Collect endlessly falling shapes in a line and score points!

The main goal of the game is to position the falling pieces so that they fill the horizontal lines without gaps.
Scoring system:
1 line = 40 points ? level,
2 lines = 100 points ? level,
3 lines = 300 points ? level,
4 lines = 1200 points ? level.
Difficulty levels
The level increases every 10 cleared lines.
With each level, the falling speed of the pieces increases.
At each new level, the speed increases by 0.1 seconds.
Initial speed: 1 second per step down.

The left/right arrows - horizontal movement of the shape.
The up arrow - shape's rotation.
Down arrow - accelerated fall.
Space bar - pause /continue the game.
